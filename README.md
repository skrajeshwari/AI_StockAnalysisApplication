# Stock insights application

This is a repository for the Stock Prices Insights project. In this project, we are:

1. Loading the data from pickle files(constituent_stock_prices.pkl, constituent_stock_fundamentals.pkl).
2. Storing the data in a SQLite database (Tables: stock_prices, income_statement, balancesheet_statement, cashflow_statement).
3. Using LLMs to create chains for querying insights from this database.

Each table stores financial data related to companies, identified by their symbols in capital letters. The stock_prices table tracks daily stock price information, while the other three tables provide detailed financial statements, including income, balance sheet, and cash flow data for various companies.

The chatbot application is built with Chainlit and allows users to ask questions within context and get relevant responses generated by the LLM.
